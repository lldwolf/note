<A NAME="BFCCDAFH"></A><h1>About using OLE in reports </h1>
<A NAME="TI4332"></A><p>A report can include a control that is a container for
an OLE object. The container stores information about the application
that created the object and it can launch the application to display
or modify the OLE object.</p>
<A NAME="TI4333"></A><p>The container can fill the whole report, when you create
a new report using the OLE presentation style, or it can exist
alongside other controls in a report, when you add an OLE object
to an existing report. You can also read OLE data from a blob
column in a database and display the objects in the report.</p>
<A NAME="TI4334"></A><p>You can use OLE objects in reports in the following ways:<A NAME="TI4335"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi><b>OLE object in
a report</b>    The OLE object is displayed in its container control with
the report data and other controls, such as bitmaps or text.
You can associate it with data in a particular row, the rows on
a page, or with all rows. You choose which columns in the report are
transferred to the OLE object. You can add an OLE container control
to a report that uses any presentation style that supports multiple reports
(this does not include the graph and RichText presentation styles).</li>
<li class=ds><b>OLE presentation style</b>    The OLE presentation style is similar to an OLE object in
a report. The difference is that the OLE container is <i>the
only</i>
 control in the report. The underlying data is <i>not</i>
 presented
in column controls and <i>there are no other</i>
 controls,
such as bitmaps or text. The OLE object is <i>always</i>
 associated
with all the rows in the report.</li>
<li class=ds><b>OLE database blob column</b>    OLE objects that are stored in the database in a blob column
are displayed in each row of the report.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI4336"></A><p>You can also add ActiveX controls (also called OLE custom
controls or OCXs) to reports. ActiveX controls range from simple
visual displays, such as meters and clocks, to more complex controls
that perform spellchecking or image processing.</p>
<A NAME="BFCDHAEF"></A><h4>Activating OLE objects</h4>
<A NAME="TI4337"></A><p>When you're working in the Report painter, you can start
the server application for an OLE object by selecting Open from
the popup menu. Once the server application has started, you can
use the tools provided by the server to edit the initial presentation
of the object.</p>
<A NAME="TI4338"></A><p>When you preview a report that has one or more OLE objects
associated with it, you cannot activate the OLE objects. When you
preview a report, InfoMaker retrieves data from the database and
displays the report as it will appear when printed. For this reason,
activation is not possible.</p>
<A NAME="TI4339"></A><p>To activate an OLE object, you first need to add the report
that contains the object to a form. Once you've done this,
you can activate the server application.</p>
<A NAME="TI4340"></A><p>If the OLE object is associated with <i>all rows</i>
 retrieved
and is in the foreground or background layer, not the band layer, users can
activate the object. If the object is associated with a single row
or page or is in the band layer, users can see the object but
can't activate it. Reports created using the OLE presentation style
are <i>always</i>
 associated with all rows.</p>
<A NAME="TI4341"></A><p>Unlike OLE objects, ActiveX controls are always active. They
do not contain objects that need to be opened or activated.</p>
<A NAME="TI4342"></A><h4>What's next</h4>
<A NAME="TI4343"></A><p>Whether you are inserting an OLE object into a report or
using the OLE presentation style, you use the same procedures to
define, preview, and specify data for the OLE object. Because of
their similarities, the next section discusses both OLE objects
in reports and the OLE presentation style. The last section discusses
OLE database blob columns.</p>
