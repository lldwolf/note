<A NAME="CADDEJBJ"></A><h1>Importing and exporting database profiles</h1>
<A NAME="TI1180"></A><h4>Why do this</h4>
<A NAME="TI1181"></A><p>Each database interface now provides an Import Profile(s)
and an Export Profile(s) option. You can use the Import option to
import a previously defined profile for use with an installed database
interface. Conversely, you can use the Export option to export a
defined profile for use by another user. </p>
<A NAME="TI1182"></A><p>The ability to import and export profiles provides a way to
easily move profiles between developers. It also means you no longer
have to maintain a shared file to maintain profiles. It is ideal
for mobile development when you cannot rely on connecting to a network
to share a file. </p>

<ol><li class=fi>
Highlight a database interface and select
Export Profile(s) from the popup menu. (In the Database painter,

<li class=ds>
Select the profile(s) you want to export from
the Export Profile(s) dialog box and click OK. <br><br>
The Export Profile(s) dialog box lists all profiles defined
in your registry regardless of the database interface for which
they were defined. By default, the profiles defined for the selected
database interface are marked for export. <br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
From the Select Profile File dialog box, select
a directory and a file in which to save the exported profile(s)
and click Save. <br><br>
The exported profiles can be saved to a new or existing file.
If saved to an existing file, the profile(s) are added to the existing
profiles. If a profile with the same name already exists, you are
asked if you want to overwrite it.<br><br></li></ol>
