<A NAME="X-ref386275937"></A><h1>About forms</h1>
<A NAME="TI4746"></A><p>An InfoMaker <strong>form</strong> is an electronic
document you use to enter data in a database. The form displays
existing data from your database. You can change the existing data
and add new data. You can also print a form. Each form has procedures
associated with it, which include common database tasks such as delete,
insert, and update.</p>
<A NAME="TI4747"></A><h4>Why use a form for data entry</h4>
<A NAME="TI4748"></A><p>In InfoMaker, you can enter data in your database in two
ways:</p>
<A NAME="TI4749"></A><p><A NAME="TI4750"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>In the Database painter,
you can preview a table, change data or insert a new row of data,
and update the database</li>
<li class=ds>In the Form painter, you can run a form, change
data or insert a new row of data, and update the database
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI4751"></A><p>If you need to add or change data in your database frequently,
making changes directly in the database tables is inefficient and
time-consuming. A form is designed to make data entry easier and
faster.</p>
<A NAME="TI4752"></A><p>You can design a form so that you can see all columns of data
on your screen. Your design can make data easy to view on the screen
and easy to read if printed. And you can create edit styles and
display formats to make it easier to enter and view data.</p>
<A NAME="TI4753"></A><p>Here's the Employee table in the EAS Demo DB, which
has 20 columns of data for 75 employees. When you view it in the
Database painter, you can see only a few rows and columns of data
at a time:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm01.gif">
<A NAME="TI4754"></A><p>Changing data or entering data for a new employee directly
in the Employee table is difficult. To see other columns, you need
to scroll (or InfoMaker scrolls for you as you tab from column
to column), and you can never see all the data for an employee at
one time.</p>
<A NAME="TI4755"></A><p>Instead, you could use the following form to enter or change
employee data. The form uses InfoMaker's Freeform form
style. When you run the form, here is what it looks like:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm02.gif">
<A NAME="TI4756"></A><p>You can use this form to change data easily. You can also
insert data for a new employee: click the Insert button and a blank
form displays. You can see all the data for each employee at one
time, and with additional enhancements, the presentation of the
data can be improved for printing.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Forms in InfoMaker and in an InfoMaker application</span> <A NAME="TI4757"></A>After you design a form, you can use it within InfoMaker.
You can also take the form, package it in an InfoMaker application
with other forms and reports you have created, and distribute your
application.</p>
<A NAME="TI4758"></A>For example, you could create an Employee Data application
that includes the Employee Data form and many employee reports that
are important to your organization. When users run the application,
they get up-to-date reports and they can update the Employee database.</p>
<A NAME="TI4759"></A>For information about creating InfoMaker applications,
see <A HREF="imugp127.htm#BFCBEJEA">Chapter 17, "Working with Applications"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="X-ref353158729"></A><h2>About the Form painter's PainterBar</h2>
<A NAME="TI4760"></A><p>The Form painter's PainterBar provides buttons for
performing common activities you might do when creating or altering
a form definition. There is also a menu item corresponding to most
buttons.</p>
<A NAME="X-ref306625030"></A><h2>About creating new forms</h2>
<A NAME="TI4761"></A><p>When you create a new form with InfoMaker, you always specify
the data source and form style of the form. Then you define the
data for the form, and InfoMaker generates the basic form.</p>
<A NAME="TI4762"></A><p>Once you have the basic form, you can name the form and save
it. Then you can continue to enhance the form to make it easier
to use.</p>
<A NAME="TI4763"></A><p>The following discussion introduces you to a few form concepts
and terms. When you are ready to create a particular type of form,
you can follow the steps for the type.</p>
<A NAME="TI4764"></A><h4>New Form dialog box</h4>
<A NAME="TI4765"></A><p>You specify the data source and form style in the New Form
dialog box:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm04.gif">
<A NAME="TI4766"></A><h4>Data sources</h4>
<A NAME="TI4767"></A><p>The data source you use determines how InfoMaker retrieves
data for your form. You can select one of three data sources when
you create a form:</p>
<A NAME="TI4768"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI4769"></A>Data source</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI4770"></A>Pick this data source when</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4771"></A>Quick Select</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4772"></A>The data is from tables that are connected
through a key, and you need only to sort and limit data</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4773"></A>SQL Select</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4774"></A>The data is from tables that are not
connected through a key, or you want more control over the SQL SELECT
statement generated for the data source</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4775"></A>Query</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4776"></A>The data has been defined as a query</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>For master/detail forms</span> <A NAME="TI4777"></A>You always use the Quick Select data source for master/detail
forms.</p>
<A NAME="TI4778"></A><p>For complete information about data sources,
see <A HREF="imugp47.htm#CFHDGEIA">"Defining the data source "</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI4779"></A><h4>Form styles</h4>
<A NAME="TI4780"></A><p>A <strong>form style</strong> is a predefined way of
presenting and processing information in a form. Each form you build
in InfoMaker is based on an existing form style.</p>
<A NAME="TI4781"></A><p>InfoMaker provides four built-in form styles:</p>
<A NAME="TI4782"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI4783"></A>Form</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI4784"></A>What it shows</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4785"></A>Freeform </td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4786"></A>One row of data at a time</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4787"></A>Grid </td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4788"></A>Rows of data in a grid</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4789"></A>Master/Detail One-To-Many </td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4790"></A>One item in a freeform area at the top
and a grid with details about the item at the bottom</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI4791"></A>Master/Detail Many-To-One </td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI4792"></A>Many items in a grid at the top and a
freeform area with details about an item at the bottom</td>
</tr>
</table>
<A NAME="TI4793"></A><p>In addition to the built-in form styles, PowerBuilder developers
in your organization can develop custom form styles to meet your
organization's needs. Custom form styles also display in
the New Form dialog box.</p>
<A NAME="TI4794"></A><p>For information about creating custom form
styles, talk to PowerBuilder developers in your organization.</p>
<A NAME="TI4795"></A><h4>Actions in a form style</h4>
<A NAME="TI4796"></A><p>Each form style has a set of predefined actions. An <strong>action</strong> is
a procedure you can attach to buttons you place in a form. Usually
a style includes the common database actions (insert, update, and
delete rows). Each of InfoMaker's built-in form styles
has these database actions and additional actions that are useful
and appropriate to the form style.</p>
<A NAME="TI4797"></A><p>For example, you can place a button in a form and then attach
the Print action to it. After you run the form, you can print the
current data by clicking the button:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm05.gif">
<br><img src="images/dfrm06.gif">
<A NAME="TI4798"></A><p>Actions are also available through the toolbar and menu items
when you run a form.</p>
<A NAME="TI4799"></A><h2>Freeform forms</h2>
<A NAME="TI4800"></A><p>You use freeform forms for basic data maintenance.</p>
<A NAME="TI4801"></A><p>In freeform forms, you see one row of data at a time. You
can arrange the information any way you want. When you run the form,
you can add, modify, and delete rows of data.</p>
<A NAME="TI4802"></A><p>For example, the following form is a freeform form that allows
you to view and update customer information. This form uses all
columns in the Customer table in the EAS Demo DB.</p>
<A NAME="TI4803"></A><p>After a few enhancements have been made to the basic form,
here is the freeform form with data:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm07.gif">
<A NAME="X-ref386276023"></A><h2>Grid forms</h2>
<A NAME="TI4804"></A><p>You use grid forms for basic data maintenance where you want
to be able to view and update more than one row of data at a time.</p>
<A NAME="TI4805"></A><p>The data in a grid form displays in a rigid grid. When running
a grid form, you can resize and reorder columns.</p>
<A NAME="TI4806"></A><p>For example, the following form is a grid form that allows
you to view information for many customers at a time. This form
uses all columns in the Customer table in the EAS Demo DB:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm08.gif">
<A NAME="TI4807"></A><h3>Working in a grid form</h3>
<A NAME="TI4808"></A><p>When you design and run a grid form, you can resize and reorder
columns. </p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To resize a column:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Position the pointer at a column boundary.<br><br>
The pointer changes shape to a 2-headed arrow.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Drag the mouse to move the boundary.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Release the mouse button when the column is the
correct width. <br><br></li></ol>
<br><p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To reorder columns:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select a column heading.<br><br>
InfoMaker selects the column and displays a line representing
the column border:<br><br><br><img src="images/dfrm09.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Drag the column left or right.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Release the mouse button to drop the column into
place.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="X-ref386276059"></A><h2>Master/Detail One-To-Many forms</h2>
<A NAME="TI4809"></A><p>Frequently, you may have data in one table that is related
to data in another table in a one-to-many relationship. For example:</p>
<A NAME="TI4810"></A><p><A NAME="TI4811"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>You maintain information
about departments and their employees. In <i>one</i>
 department
there are <i>many</i>
 employees. That is, there is
a one-to-many relationship between departments and employees.</li>
<li class=ds>You maintain information about your customers and
their orders. <i>One</i>
 customer typically has <i>many</i>
 orders.
There is a one-to-many relationship between customers and orders.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI4812"></A><p>You may want to display this type of relationship in a form.
Such a form is called a master/detail one-to-many form.</p>
<A NAME="TI4813"></A><p>For example, the following form displays information about
one department at the top and all of that department's
employees at the bottom:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm10.gif">
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>About the ID column</span> <A NAME="TI4814"></A>Note the department's ID in the master table at the
top of the form. Although you cannot see the department's
ID in the detail table at the bottom of the form, it's
there. The ID has been hidden by moving grid boundaries to cover
the ID column. Since all the ID values are the same, hiding the
values is useful.</p>
<A NAME="TI4815"></A>If the detail table did not include the ID, the form would
not be updatable. If you forget to include necessary columns, InfoMaker prompts
you.</p>
<A NAME="TI4816"></A><p>The following dialog box shows the database tables that handle
the data on this form: the Department table and the Employee table
in the EAS Demo DB. The Department table is the master table, and
the Employee table is the detail table.</p>
<A NAME="TI4817"></A><p>Note that there is a primary/foreign key relationship
between the tables: the Dept_id column in the Employee
table has the same values as the Dept_id column in the
Department table:</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm11.gif">
<A NAME="X-ref386276041"></A><h2>Master/Detail Many-To-One forms</h2>
<A NAME="TI4818"></A><p>You might have a lot of information about a particular class
of entities, such as customers, employees, or parts. You might want
to be able to scroll easily through a list of the entities (the <i>many</i>
),
then see the details for <i>one</i>
 of them. You do
that in a master/detail many-to-one form.</p>
<A NAME="TI4819"></A><p>Typically, you select one or two columns for the master table
(enough for you to identify the entity, such as customer or employee)
and the rest of the columns pertaining to the entity for the detail
table.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Selecting columns for the master and detail areas</span> <A NAME="TI4820"></A>In a master/detail many-to-one form, you usually
pick one or two columns for the master area and many columns for
the detail area, and you change data or insert new data in the detail
area only. The data in the master area is usually updated with a
different form. To be able to insert new rows in the master area or
detail area, you must include all columns that have been defined
in the database as requiring values.</p>
<A NAME="TI4821"></A>For information about defining data so that
a form can update a database, see <A HREF="imugp116.htm#X-ref386528994">"Defining data so that
a form can update a database"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI4822"></A><p>For example, the following form lists all customers at the
top (the master area) and the details for the selected customer
at the bottom (the detail area):</p>
<br><img src="images/dfrm12.gif">
<A NAME="TI4823"></A><p>Both the master and detail areas use the Customer table in
the EAS Demo DB. The Company_name and Id columns were chosen
for the master table, and all columns were chosen for the detail
table. </p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>About the Id column</span> <A NAME="TI4824"></A>Since the Id column is the primary key, you must select the
Id column to make the detail part for the form updatable, but you
can delete it from the detail part.</p>
