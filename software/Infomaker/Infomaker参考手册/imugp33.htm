<A NAME="CCJCHJFB"></A><h1>About managing databases </h1>
<A NAME="TI841"></A><p>InfoMaker supports many database management systems (DBMSs).
For the most part, you work the same way in InfoMaker for each
DBMS. But because each DBMS provides some unique features (which InfoMaker makes
use of), there are some issues that are specific to a particular
DBMS.</p>
<A NAME="TI842"></A><p>For complete information about using your
DBMS, see <i>Connecting to Your Database</i>
.</p>
<A NAME="TI843"></A><h4>What you can do</h4>
<A NAME="TI844"></A><p>If you installed the Database painter, you can do the following
in any DBMS to which you have been given access by the database
administrator:<A NAME="TI845"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Modify local table and column
properties</li>
<li class=ds>Retrieve, change, and insert data and modify existing
tables</li>
<li class=ds>Create new local tables or modify existing tables
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI846"></A><p>If you do not install the Database painter, you can report
on data in tables to which you have access, but you cannot change
data, create new tables, or modify existing tables.</p>
<A NAME="TI847"></A><h4>Setting the database connection </h4>
<A NAME="TI848"></A><p>When you open a painter that communicates with the database
(such as the Database painter or Report painter), InfoMaker connects
you to the database you used last if you are not already connected.
If the connection to the default database fails, the painter still
opens. </p>
<A NAME="TI849"></A><p>If you do not want to connect to the database you used last,
you can deselect the Connect to Default Profile option in the Database
Preferences dialog box. </p>
<A NAME="TI850"></A><h4>Changing the database connection</h4>
<A NAME="TI851"></A><p>You can change to a different database anytime. You can have
several database connections open at a time, although only one connection
can be active. The database components for each open connection
are listed in the Objects view. </p>
<A NAME="TI852"></A><p>The Database painter title bar displays the number of open
connections and which is active. The title bar for each view displays
the connection with which it is currently associated. You can change
the connection with which a view is associated by dragging the profile
name for a different connection onto the view. </p>
<A NAME="TI853"></A><p>For more about changing the database you are
connected to, see <i>Connecting to Your Database</i>
.</p>
<A NAME="TI854"></A><h4>Creating and deleting databases</h4>
<A NAME="TI855"></A><p>When you are connected to Adaptive Server Anywhere, you can create a new database
or delete an existing database using the Database painter.</p>
<A NAME="TI856"></A><p>For all other DBMSs, creating and deleting a database is an
administrative task that you cannot do within InfoMaker.</p>
