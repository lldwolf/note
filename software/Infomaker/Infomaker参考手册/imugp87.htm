<A NAME="X-ref299517487"></A><h1>About graphs </h1>
<A NAME="TI3449"></A><p>Often the best way to display information is graphically.
You can add a graph to a report and work with it there, or you can
use the Graph presentation style to create a standalone graph.You
can use graphs to supplement the numbers in a report or you can
replace numbers with a graph.</p>
<A NAME="TI3450"></A><p>InfoMaker provides many types of graphs and allows you to
customize your graphs in many ways. Probably
most of your use of graphs will be in a report--the
source of the data for your graphs will be the database. </p>
<A NAME="TI3451"></A><h2>Parts of a graph</h2>
<A NAME="TI3452"></A><p>Here is a column graph created in InfoMaker that contains
most major parts of a graph. It shows quarterly sales of three products:
Stellar, Cosmic, and Galactic printers:</p>

<A NAME="TI3453"></A><h3>How data is represented</h3>
<A NAME="TI3454"></A><p>Graphs display data points. To define graphs, you need to
know how the data is represented. InfoMaker organizes data into
three components:</p>
<A NAME="TI3455"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI3456"></A>Component</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI3457"></A>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3458"></A>Series</td>
<td valign=top><p><b>A set of data points</b>   Each set of related data points makes up one series. In the
preceding graph, there is a series for Stellar sales, another series
for Cosmic sales, and another series for Galactic sales. Each series
in a graph is distinguished by color, pattern, or symbol</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3459"></A>Categories</td>
<td valign=top><p><b>The major divisions of the
data</b>   Series data are divided into categories, which are often non-numeric.
In the preceding graph, the series are divided into four categories:
Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. Categories represent values of the independent
variable(s)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3460"></A>Values</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3461"></A>The values for the data points (dependent
variables)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<A NAME="TI3462"></A><h3>Organization of a graph</h3>
<A NAME="TI3463"></A><p>The following table lists the parts of a typical graph:</p>
<A NAME="TI3464"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI3465"></A>Part of graph</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI3466"></A>What it is</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3467"></A>Title</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3468"></A>An optional title for the graph. The
title appears at the top of the graph</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3469"></A>Value axis</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3470"></A>The axis of the graph along which the
values of the dependent variable(s) are plotted. In a column graph,
as shown in the preceding graph, the Value axis corresponds to the
y axis in an XY presentation. But in other types of graphs, such
as a bar graph, the Value axis can be along the x dimension</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3471"></A>Category axis</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3472"></A>The axis along which are plotted the
major divisions of the data, representing the independent variable(s).
In the preceding graph, the Category axis corresponds to the x axis.
It plots four categories: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. These form the major
divisions of data in the graph</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3473"></A>Series</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3474"></A>A set of data points. There are three
series in the preceding graph: Stellar, Cosmic, and Galactic. In
bar and column charts, each series is represented by bars or columns
of one color or pattern</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3475"></A>Series axis</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3476"></A>The axis along which the series are plotted
in three-dimensional (3D) graphs</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3477"></A>Legend</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3478"></A>An optional listing of the series. The
preceding graph contains a legend that shows how each series is
represented in the graph</td>
</tr>

<A NAME="TI3479"></A><h2>Types of graphs</h2>
<A NAME="TI3480"></A><p>InfoMaker provides many types of graphs for you to choose
from. You choose the type in the Define Graph Style dialog box or
in the General page in the Properties view for the graph.</p>
<br><img src="images/Graph03.gif">
<A NAME="TI3481"></A><h3>Area, bar, column, and line graphs</h3>
<A NAME="TI3482"></A><p>Area, bar, column, and line graphs are conceptually very similar.
They differ only in how they physically represent the data values--whether
they use areas, bars, columns, or lines to represent the values.
All other properties are the same. Typically you use area and line
graphs to display continuous data and use bar and column graphs
to display noncontinuous data.</p>
<A NAME="TI3483"></A><p>The only difference between a bar graph and a column graph
is the orientation: in column graphs, values are plotted along the
y axis and categories are plotted along the x axis. In bar graphs,
values are plotted along the x axis and categories are plotted along
the y axis.</p>
<A NAME="TI3484"></A><h3>Pie graphs</h3>
<A NAME="TI3485"></A><p>Pie graphs typically show one series of data points with each
data point shown as a percentage of a whole. The following pie graph
shows the sales for Stellar printers for each quarter. You can easily
see the relative values in each quarter. (InfoMaker automatically
calculates the percentages of each slice of the pie.)</p>
<br><img src="images/Graph08.gif">
<A NAME="TI3486"></A><p>You can have pie graphs with more than one series if you want;
the series are shown in concentric circles. Multiseries pie graphs
can be useful in comparing series of data.</p>
<A NAME="TI3487"></A><h3>Scatter graphs</h3>
<A NAME="TI3488"></A><p>Scatter graphs show xy data points. Typically you use scatter
graphs to show the relationship between two sets of numeric values. Non-numeric values, such as string
and DateTime data types, do not display correctly.</p>
<A NAME="TI3489"></A><p>Scatter graphs do not use categories. Instead, numeric values
are plotted along both axes--as opposed to other graphs,
which have values along one axis and categories along the other
axis.</p>
<A NAME="TI3490"></A><p>For example, the following data shows the effect of speed
on the mileage of a sedan:</p>
<A NAME="TI3491"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI3492"></A>Speed</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI3493"></A>Mileage</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3494"></A>10</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3495"></A>12</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3496"></A>20</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3497"></A>18</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3498"></A>30</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3499"></A>21</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3500"></A>40</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3501"></A>23</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3502"></A>50</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3503"></A>26</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3504"></A>60</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3505"></A>26</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3506"></A>70</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3507"></A>24</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI3508"></A>80</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI3509"></A>20</td>
</tr>

<A NAME="TI3510"></A><p>Here is the data in a scatter graph:</p>
<br><img src="images/Graph09.gif">
<A NAME="TI3511"></A><p>You can have multiple series of data in a scatter graph. In
the above example, you might want to plot mileage versus speed for
several makes of cars in the same graph.</p>
<A NAME="TI3512"></A><h3>Three-dimensional graphs</h3>
<A NAME="TI3513"></A><p>You can also create 3-dimensional (3D) graphs of area, bar,
column, line, and pie graphs. In 3D graphs (except for 3D pie graphs),
series are plotted along a third axis (the Series axis) instead
of along the Category axis. You can specify the perspective to use
to show the third dimension:</p>
<br><img src="images/Graph11.gif">
<A NAME="TI3514"></A><h3>Stacked graphs</h3>
<A NAME="TI3515"></A><p>In bar and column graphs, you can choose to stack the bars
and columns. In stacked graphs, each category is represented as
one bar or column instead of as separate bars or columns for each
series:</p>
