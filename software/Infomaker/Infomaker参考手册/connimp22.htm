<A NAME="X-ref289083822"></A><h1>About native database interfaces</h1>
<A NAME="TI513"></A><p>The native database interfaces provide native connections
to many databases and DBMSs. This section describes how the native
database interfaces access these databases.</p>
<A NAME="TI514"></A><p>For a complete list of the supported native
database interfaces, see "Supported Database Interfaces" in online
Help.</p>
<A NAME="TI515"></A><h2>What is a native database interface?</h2>
<A NAME="TI516"></A><p>A native database interface is a direct connection to your
data in InfoMaker.</p>
<A NAME="TI517"></A><p>Each native database interface uses its own interface DLL
to communicate with a specified database through a vendor-specific
database API. For example, the Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise
interface uses a DLL named PBSYC<i>n</i>
0.DLL to access
the database, while the Oracle 8.0.4 database interface accesses
the database through PBO84<i>n</i>
0.DLL.</p>
<A NAME="TI518"></A><p>In contrast, a standard database interface uses a standard
API to communicate with the database. For example, InfoMaker can
use a single-interface DLL to communicate with the ODBC Driver Manager
and corresponding driver to access any ODBC data source.</p>
<A NAME="TI519"></A><h2>Components of a database interface connection</h2>
<A NAME="TI520"></A><p>When you use a native database interface to access a database,
your connection goes through several layers before reaching the
data. Each layer is a separate component of the connection and each
component may come from a different vendor.</p>

<A NAME="TI521"></A><p>For diagrams showing the specific components
of your connection, see "Basic software components" in the section
in this chapter for your native database interface.</p>
<A NAME="TI522"></A><h2>Using a native database interface</h2>
<A NAME="TI523"></A><p>You perform several basic steps to use a native database interface
to access a database. </p>
<A NAME="TI524"></A><h3>About preparing to use the database</h3>
<A NAME="TI525"></A><p>The
first step in connecting to a database through a native database
interface is to prepare to use the database. Preparing the database
ensures that you will be able to access and use your data in InfoMaker.</p>
<A NAME="TI526"></A><p>You must prepare the database <i>outside</i>
 InfoMaker <i>before</i>
 you
start the product, then define the database interface and connect
to it. The requirements differ for each database--but in
general, preparing a database involves four basic steps.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To prepare to use your database with InfoMaker:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Make sure the required database server
software is properly installed and configured at your site.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
If network software is required, make sure it
is properly installed and configured at your site and on the client
computer so that you can connect to the database server.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Make sure the required database client software
is properly installed and configured on the client computer. (Typically,
the client computer is the one running InfoMaker.)<br><br>
You must obtain the client software from your database vendor
and make sure that the version you install supports <i>all</i>
 of
the following:<A NAME="TI527"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>The operating
system running on the client computer</li>
<li class=ds>The version of the database that you want to access</li>
<li class=ds>The version of InfoMaker that you are running
</li>
</ul>
<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Verify that you can connect to the server and
database you want to access outside InfoMaker.<br><br></li></ol>

database, see "Preparing to use the database" in the section in
this chapter for your native database interface.</p>
<A NAME="TI529"></A><h3>About installing native database interfaces</h3>
<A NAME="TI530"></A><p>After you prepare to use the database, you must install the
native database interface that accesses the database.</p>
<A NAME="TI531"></A><p>For instructions, see the<i> Installation
Guide</i>
<i></i>
.</p>
<A NAME="TI532"></A><h3>About defining native database interfaces</h3>
<A NAME="TI533"></A><p>Once you are ready to access the database, you start InfoMaker and
define the database interface. To define a database interface, you
must create a database profile by completing the Database Profile
Setup dialog box for that interface.</p>
<A NAME="TI534"></A><p>For general instructions, see <A HREF="connimp5.htm#X-ref298585259">"About creating database
profiles"</A>. For instructions
about defining database interface parameters unique to a particular database,
see "Preparing to use the database" in the section in this chapter
for your database interface. </p>

and define the database interface you are using, see the section
in this chapter for your native database interface.</p>
