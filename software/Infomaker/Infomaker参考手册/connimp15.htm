<A NAME="BFCDCFDD"></A><h1>Preparing to use the JDBC interface</h1>
<A NAME="TI350"></A><p>Before you define the interface and connect to a database
via the JDBC interface, follow these steps to prepare the database
for use: <A NAME="TI351"></A>
<ol>
</li>
<li class=ds>Configure the database
server for its JDBC connection and install its JDBC-compliant driver
and network software.</li>
<li class=ds>Verify that a Java VM is installed on your machine.</li>
<li class=ds>Use the JavaVM DBParm to tell InfoMaker what
version of the Java VM is running on your machine. You must already
have installed the Java VM. </li>
<li class=ds>Install the JDBC interface.</li>
<li class=ds>Set or verify the settings in the PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables and the Java tab of the System Options dialog
box.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<A NAME="TI352"></A><h4>Step 1: configure the database server</h4>
<A NAME="TI353"></A><p>You must configure the database server to make JDBC connections
as well as install the JDBC driver and network software.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To configure the database server for its JDBC
connection:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Make sure the database server is configured
to make JDBC connections. For configuration instructions, see your
database vendor's documentation. <br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Make sure the appropriate JDBC driver software
is installed and running on the database server. <br><br>
The driver vendor's documentation should provide
the driver name, URL format, and any driver-specific properties
you need to specify in the database profile.<br><br><p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Configuring the jConnect driver</span> <A NAME="TI354"></A>Make sure to complete the configuration steps required by
the jConnect driver such as installing the JDBC stored procedures
in Adaptive Server databases. Also verify that the CLASSPATH environment
variable on your machine or the Classpaths list on the Java tab
of the PowerBuilder System Options dialog box include an entry pointing
to the location of the jConnect driver. For example, if you are
using jConnect 5.2, you should include an entry similar to the following:</p>
<A NAME="TI355"></A><b>\Program Files\Sybase\Shared\jConnect-5_2\classes\jconn2.jar</b></p>
<A NAME="TI356"></A>For more information about configuring jConnect, see the jConnect
for JDBC documentation. </p>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Make sure the required network software (such
as TCP/IP) is installed and running on your computer and
is properly configured so that you can connect to the database server
at your site.<br><br>
You must install the network communication driver that supports
the network protocol and operating system platform you are using. <br><br>
For installation and configuration instructions,
see your network or database administrator.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI357"></A><h4>Step 2: verify the Java VM</h4>
<A NAME="TI358"></A><p>Make sure the appropriate Java Virtual Machine is installed
and running on your client computer -- Microsoft VM for
Java or Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Both VMs are available
free of charge from their respective vendors<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/java/download.htm"></A>
 and<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products"></A>
.</p>
<A NAME="TI359"></A><h4>Step 3: install the JDBC interface</h4>
<A NAME="TI360"></A><p>When prompted to do so by the InfoMaker Setup program, select
the appropriate JDBC interface. </p>
<A NAME="TI361"></A><p>For instructions, see the <i>Installation
Guide</i>
<i></i>
.</p>
<A NAME="TI362"></A><h4>Step 4: set or verify the settings in the PATH
and CLASSPATH variables</h4>
<A NAME="TI363"></A><p>Set or verify that the settings in the PATH and CLASSPATH
environment variables point to the appropriate,
fully qualified file names. </p>
<A NAME="TI364"></A><p>If you are using Java 1.1, the PATH environment variable should
include an entry for the Sun Java VM (for example, <i>path</i>\ JDK118\bin)
and the CLASSPATH environment variable should include an entry for
the packages included in classes.zip (for example, <i>path</i>\ JDK118\lib\classes.zip).
The CLASSPATH environment variable should also include an entry for the JDBC driver classes
(such as jconn2.jar). </p>
<A NAME="TI365"></A><p>If you are using Java 1.2 or later, you do not need to include
the Sun Java VM packages in your CLASSPATH variable, but your PATH
environment variable must include an entry for the Sun Java VM library,
jvm.dll (for example, <i>path</i>\ JDK122\JRE\bin\classic).</p>
<A NAME="TI366"></A><p>Also verify that you do not have another Java VM entry in
the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables, as multiple VM entries
may cause the database connection to fail. </p>
