<A NAME="CFHBFDDF"></A><h1>Generating and saving a report </h1>
<A NAME="TI1605"></A><p>Once you have finished interacting with the wizard for the
presentation style you are using, InfoMaker generates the report and
takes you to the Report painter.</p>
<A NAME="TI1606"></A><p>When generating the report, InfoMaker may use information
from a facility called the <strong>extended attribute system
tables</strong>. If this information is available, InfoMaker uses
it.</p>
<A NAME="TI1607"></A><h2>About the extended attribute system tables and reports</h2>
<A NAME="TI1608"></A><p>The extended attribute system tables is a set of tables maintained
by the Database painter. It contains information about database
tables and columns. Extended attribute information extends database
definitions by recording information that is relevant to using database
data in screens and reports.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Extended attribute information applies to forms, too</span> <A NAME="TI1609"></A>InfoMaker uses extended attribute information when generating
a form the same way it uses it when generating a report.</p>
<A NAME="TI1610"></A><p>For example, labels and headings you defined for columns in
the Database painter are used in the generated report. Similarly,
if you associated an edit style with a column in the Database painter,
that edit style is automatically used for the column in the report.</p>
<A NAME="TI1611"></A><p>When generating a report, InfoMaker uses the following
information from the extended attribute system tables:</p>
<A NAME="TI1612"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI1613"></A>For</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI1614"></A>InfoMaker uses</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI1615"></A>Tables</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI1616"></A>Fonts specified for labels, headings,
and data</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI1617"></A>Columns</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI1618"></A>Text specified for labels and headings<br> Display
formats<br> Column widths, heights, and justifications<br> Edit
styles</td>
</tr>
</table>
<A NAME="TI1619"></A><p>If there is no extended attribute information for the database
tables and columns you are using, you can set the text for headings
and labels, the fonts, and the display formats in the Report painter.
The difference is that you have to do this individually for every report that
you create using the data.</p>
<A NAME="TI1620"></A><p>If you want to change something that came from the extended
attribute system tables, you can change it in the Report painter.
The changes you make in the Report painter apply only to the report you
are working on.</p>
<A NAME="TI1621"></A><p>The advantage of using the extended attribute system tables
is that it saves time and ensures consistency. You only have to
specify the information once, in the database. Since InfoMaker uses
the information whenever anyone creates a new report with the
data, it's more likely that the appearance and labels of
data items will be consistent.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>If you have installed InfoMaker without the Database
painter</span> <A NAME="TI1622"></A>You cannot create extended attribute information if you have
installed InfoMaker without the Database painter. Another InfoMaker user
with the Database painter or a PowerBuilder user can add extended
attribute information into the database for you. Or you can change
the extended attributes individually in each report.</p>
<A NAME="TI1623"></A><p>For more information about the extended attribute
system tables, see <A HREF="imugp31.htm#BFCDFDFD">Chapter 3, "Managing the Database"</A>,
and <A HREF="imugp256.htm#CCJEBFGB">Appendix A, "The Extended
Attribute System Tables"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI1624"></A><h2>Saving the report</h2>
<A NAME="TI1625"></A><p>When you have created a report, you should save it. The
first time you save it you will give it a name. As you work, you
should save your report frequently so that you don't
lose changes.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To save the report:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select File&gt;Save from the menu
bar.<br><br>
If you have previously saved the report, InfoMaker saves
the new version in the same library and returns you to the Report painter.<br><br>
If you have not previously saved the report, InfoMaker displays
the Save Report dialog box.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
(Optional) Enter comments in the Comments box
to describe the report.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Enter a name for the report in the Reports
box.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Click OK.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI1626"></A><h3>Naming the report</h3>
<A NAME="TI1627"></A><p>The report name can be any valid InfoMaker identifier
up to 40 contiguous characters.</p>
