<A NAME="TI562"></A><p>Your company may store a library (a PBL file) of queries on
a network. Having a query library is a convenient way to make carefully
developed and well-tested queries that go against corporate data
available to everyone.</p>
<A NAME="TI563"></A><p>If you want to access a query library on a network, you must
identify it as a source of queries. Then when you create a new DataWindow
object, report, form, or pipeline, and specify Query as your data
source, InfoMaker includes the queries from the query library in
your list of available queries.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To identify a query library as a source of queries:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Click the Library List button in the PowerBar
and then select the Query tab.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Enter one or more library search paths in the
Library Search Path box.<br><br>
<i>or</i>
<br><br>
Click Browse to select a library search path and then
click Open to add the library to the Library Search Path box.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Click OK.<br><br>
InfoMaker sets the library search path for queries. This
means that when you start creating a new DataWindow object, report,
form, or pipeline, and choose Query as the data source, your list
of available queries includes all queries in all the libraries in
your search path as established in this process.<br><br></li></ol>
