<A NAME="CCJBHEBB"></A><h1>Creating and deleting an Adaptive Server Anywhere database</h1>
<A NAME="TI928"></A><p>In InfoMaker you work within an existing database. With one
exception, creating or deleting a database is an administrative
task that is not performed directly in InfoMaker. The one exception
is that you can create and delete a local Adaptive Server Anywhere database from
within InfoMaker.</p>
<A NAME="TI929"></A><p>For information about creating and deleting
other databases, see your DBMS documentation.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To create a local Adaptive Server Anywhere database:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
From the Objects view, launch the Create
ASA Database utility included with the ODBC interface.<br><br>
The Create Adaptive Server Anywhere Database dialog box displays.<br><br><br><img src="images/dbasa.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
In the Database Name box, specify the filename
and path of the database you are creating. <br><br>
If you do not provide a file extension, the database filename
is given the extension DB.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Define other properties of the database as needed. <br><br>
If you are using a non-English database, you can specify a
code page in the Collation Sequence box.<br><br>
For complete information about filling in
the dialog box, click the Help button in the dialog box.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Click OK.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><p><b>What happens</b>   When you click OK, InfoMaker does the following:<A NAME="TI930"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Creates a database with the
specified name in the specified directory or folder. If a database
with the same name exists, you are asked whether you want to replace
it.</li>
<li class=ds>Adds a data source to the ODBC.INI key in the registry.
The data source has the same name as the database unless one with
the same name already exists, in which case a suffix is appended.</li>
<li class=ds>Creates a database profile and adds it to the registry.
The profile has the same name as the database unless one with the
same name already exists, in which case a suffix is appended.</li>
<li class=ds>Connects to the new database.
</li>
</ul>
