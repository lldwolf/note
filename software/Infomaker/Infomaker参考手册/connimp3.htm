<A NAME="X-ref347903822"></A><h1>Accessing data in InfoMaker</h1>
<A NAME="TI78"></A><p>There are several ways to access data in the InfoMaker development environment: <A NAME="TI79"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Through one of the standard
database interfaces such as ODBC, JDBC, or OLE DB</li>
<li class=ds>Through one of the native database interfaces
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI80"></A><h4>Standard database interfaces</h4>
<A NAME="TI81"></A><p>A standard database interface communicates with a database
via a standard-compliant driver (in the case of ODBC and JDBC) or
data provider (in the case of OLE DB). The standard-compliant driver
or data provider translates the abstract function calls defined
by the standard's API into calls that are understood by
a specific database. To use a standard interface, you need to install
the standard's API and a suitable driver or data provider.
You then install the standard database interface you want to use
to access your DBMS by selecting the interface in the InfoMaker Setup
program. InfoMaker currently supports the following standard interfaces: <A NAME="TI82"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)</li>
<li class=ds>Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)</li>
<li class=ds>Microsoft's Universal Data Access Component
OLE DB
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI83"></A><h4>Native database interfaces</h4>
<A NAME="TI84"></A><p>A native database interface communicates with a database via
a direct connection. It communicates to a database using that database's
native API. </p>
<A NAME="TI85"></A><p>To access data through one of the native database interfaces,
you must first install the appropriate database software on the
server and client workstations at your site. You then install the
native database interface that accesses your DBMS by selecting the
interface in the InfoMaker Setup program.</p>
<A NAME="TI86"></A><p>For example, if you have the appropriate Sybase Adaptive Server
Enterprise server and client software installed, you can access
the database by installing the Adaptive Server Enterprise database
interface.</p>
<A NAME="TI87"></A><h4>InfoMaker with other Sybase products</h4>
<A NAME="TI88"></A><p>If your version of InfoMaker was provided with another Sybase
product, see the Help for that product for information about database
connectivity features.</p>
