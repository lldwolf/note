<A NAME="CAICEEJB"></A><h1>Working in the Report painter </h1>
<A NAME="TI1671"></A><p>The Report painter provides six views related to the report you
are working on. Interacting with these views is how you work in
the Report painter.</p>
<A NAME="TI1672"></A><p>The following picture shows a report in the Report painter with
three views open: the Design view, the Preview view, and the Properties
view.</p>
<br><img src="images/Dwen01ai.gif">
<p><b>Design view</b>   Shows a representation of the report and its controls.
You use this view to design the layout and appearance of the report.
Changes you make are immediately shown in the Preview view and the
Properties view.</p>
<p><b>Preview view</b>   Shows the report with data as it will appear at execution
time. If the Print Preview toggle is selected, you see the report as
it would appear when printed.</p>
<p><b>Properties view</b>   Displays the property sheet for the currently selected control(s)
in the report, for the currently selected band in the report,
or for the report itself. You can view and change the values
of properties in this view.</p>
<A NAME="TI1673"></A><p>There are three other views available:</p>
<p><b>Control List view</b>   List all controls in the report. Selecting controls in
this view selects them in the Design view and the Properties view
too. You can also sort controls by Control Name, Type, or Tag. </p>
<p><b>Data view</b>   Displays the data that can be used to populate a report and
allows manipulation of that data. </p>
<p><b>Column Specifications view</b>   Shows a list of the columns in the data source. For the columns,
you can add, modify, and delete initial values, validation expressions,
and validation messages. You can also specify that you want a column
to be included in a prompt for retrieval criteria during data retrieval.
To add a column to the report, you can drag and drop the column
from the Column Specifications view to Design view. For external
or stored procedure data sources, you can add, delete, and edit
columns (column name, type, and length).</p>
<A NAME="CAICEIJC"></A><h2>Understanding the Report painter Design view</h2>
<A NAME="TI1674"></A><p>With many presentation styles, the Report painter Design view
is divided into areas called <strong>bands</strong>. Each
band corresponds to a section of the displayed report.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Applicability of information</span> <A NAME="TI1675"></A>Some of the information presented in this section doesn't
apply to all report presentation styles. </p>
<A NAME="TI1676"></A><p>A report is divided into four bands: header, detail, summary,
and footer. Each band is identified by a bar containing the name
of the band above the bar and an arrow pointing to the band.</p>
<A NAME="TI1677"></A><p>Here is the Design view for a tabular report:</p>
<br><img src="images/dwen01.gif">
<A NAME="TI1678"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI1679"></A>Band</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI1680"></A>Used to display</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI1681"></A>Header</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI1682"></A>Information at the top of every screen
or page, such as the name of the report or current date</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI1683"></A>Detail</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI1684"></A>Data from the database or other data
source</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI1685"></A>Summary</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI1686"></A>Summary information that displays after
all the data, such as totals and counts</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI1687"></A>Footer</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI1688"></A>Information displayed at the bottom of
every page or screen, such as page number and page count</td>
</tr>
</table>
<A NAME="TI1689"></A><h3>About the header band</h3>
<A NAME="TI1690"></A><p>The header band contains heading information that is displayed
at the top of every screen or page. The presentation style determines
the contents of the header band:<A NAME="TI1691"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>If the presentation style is Tabular, Grid, or N-Up, the headings
defined for the columns in the Database painter display in the header
band and the columns display on a single line across the detail
band </li>
<li class=ds>If the presentation style is Freeform, the header
band is empty and labels display in the detail band next to each
column
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI1692"></A><p>You can specify additional heading information (such as a
date) in the header band and can include pictures, graphic controls, and
color to enhance the appearance of the band.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Displaying the current date</span> <A NAME="TI1693"></A>To include the current date in the header, you place a computed
field that uses the Today InfoMaker function in the header band.</p>
<A NAME="TI1694"></A>For information, see <A HREF="imugp56.htm#CAICBBCE">"Adding computed fields to
a report"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI1695"></A><h3>About the detail band</h3>
<A NAME="TI1696"></A><p>The detail band displays the retrieved data. The number of
rows of data that display in the report at one time is determined
by the following expression: <pre><i>(Height of the report - Height of headers and footers) / <br> Height of the detail band</i></pre>
</p>
<A NAME="TI1697"></A><p>The presentation style determines the contents of the detail
band: <A NAME="TI1698"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>If the presentation style is Tabular, Grid, N-Up,
or Label, the detail band displays column names, representing the
columns</li>
<li class=ds>If the presentation style is Freeform, the labels
defined for the columns in the Database painter display in the detail
band with boxes for the data to the right 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>How InfoMaker names the columns in the Design view</span> <A NAME="TI1699"></A>If the report uses one table, the names of the columns
in the Design view are the same as the names in the table. </p>
<A NAME="TI1700"></A>If the report uses more than one table, the names of the
columns in the Design view are <i>tablename_columnname</i>
. InfoMaker prefaces
the name of the column with the table name to prevent ambiguity,
since different tables can have columns with the same name.</p>
<A NAME="TI1701"></A><p>When you design the detail band of a report, you can specify
display information for each column of the report and add other
controls, such as text, pictures, graphs, and drawing controls.</p>
<A NAME="TI1702"></A><h3>About the summary and footer bands</h3>
<A NAME="TI1703"></A><p>You use the summary and footer bands of the report the
same way you use summary pages and page footers in a printed report:<A NAME="TI1704"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>The contents of the summary band display at the
end, after all the detail rows; this band often summarizes information
in the report</li>
<li class=ds>The contents of the footer band display at the bottom
of each screen or page of the report; this band often displays
the page number and name of the report
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI1705"></A><p>These bands can contain any information you want, including
text, drawing controls, graphs, and computed fields containing aggregate
totals.</p>
<A NAME="BFCEACCI"></A><h2>Using the Report painter toolbars</h2>
<A NAME="TI1706"></A><p>The Report painter contains three customizable PainterBars and
a StyleBar. </p>
<A NAME="TI1707"></A><p>For more information about using toolbars,
see "Using toolbars" on page 52.</p>
<A NAME="TI1708"></A><h4>PainterBars</h4>
<A NAME="TI1709"></A><p>The PainterBars include buttons for standard operations (such
as Open, Save, Undo) and for common reporting operations (such as
Preview, Percent). They also include six dropdown toolbars, which
are indicated by a small black triangle on the right part of a button:</p>
<A NAME="TI1710"></A><p>These are the dropdown toolbars that are available:</p>
<A NAME="TI1711"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI1712"></A>Dropdown Toolbar</th>

<A NAME="TI1726"></A><h4>StyleBar</h4>
<A NAME="TI1727"></A><p>The StyleBar includes buttons for applying properties (such
as bold) to selected text elements: </p>
<br><img src="images/Dwen03.gif">
<A NAME="BFCBCACJ"></A><h2>Using the Properties view in the Report painter</h2>
<A NAME="TI1728"></A><p>Each part of the report (such as text, columns, computed
fields, bands, graphs, even the report itself) has a set of
properties appropriate to the part. The properties display in the
Properties view.</p>
<A NAME="TI1729"></A><p>You can use the Properties view to modify the parts of the report.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To use the Properties view to modify the parts
of the report:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Position the mouse over the part you want
to modify.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Display the part's popup menu and select
Properties.<br><br>
If it's not already displayed, the Properties view
displays. In any case, the view displays the properties of the currently
selected control(s), band, or of the report itself. The contents
of the Properties view changes as different controls are selected
(made current).<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI1730"></A><p>The following Properties view is for a column. It has seven
tabbed property pages of information, which you access by clicking
the appropriate tab. For example, if you want to choose an edit
style for the column, you click the Edit tab. This brings the Edit
property page to the front of the Properties view:</p>
<br><img src="images/Dwen04.gif">
<A NAME="TI1731"></A><p>When you want to modify the properties of part of a report,
display the Properties view and pick the properties you want to
change. Click the various tabs to change property pages.</p>
<A NAME="BFCBFGBI"></A><h2>Selecting controls in the Report painter</h2>
<A NAME="TI1732"></A><p>The Report painter provides several ways to select controls to
act on. You can select multiple controls and act on all the selected
controls as a unit. For example, you can move all of them or change
the fonts used to display text for all of them.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Lasso selection</span> <A NAME="TI1733"></A>Use <strong>lasso selection</strong> when possible because
