<A NAME="TI5476"></A><p>Creating an executable version of an application means packaging
an application that can run on its own, outside the InfoMaker environment.
Users of your application do not need InfoMaker to run the application.</p>
<A NAME="TI5477"></A><p>When you create an application, InfoMaker generates an executable
file and an initialization file for your application. To deploy
an application however, you must distribute other files in addition
to the executable file and the initialization file. Exactly what
you distribute depends on whether users have InfoMaker installed
or not.</p>

<A NAME="TI5478"></A><p>To set up a user's machine to run your application,
you need to copy all the deployment files and database interface
files you need to the right places. If you are using an Adaptive Server Anywhere database,
the Adaptive Server Anywhere files needed to run your application must also be
installed.</p>
<A NAME="TI5479"></A><p>When you deploy an InfoMaker application, what you install
on a user's computer depends on whether the user has InfoMaker installed.</p>
<A NAME="TI5480"></A><p>If the user does not have InfoMaker installed, you need to
install the following files:</p>

<td valign=top><A NAME="TI5485"></A>You need install only the deployment

install the ODBC database driver</td>

about additional files you need to deploy and the licensing issues</td>

<A NAME="TI5492"></A><p>If the user has InfoMaker installed, you need to install
only ODBC drivers (if your database is an ODBC database).</p>
