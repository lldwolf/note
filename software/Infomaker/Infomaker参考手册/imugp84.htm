<A NAME="BFCBAJDF"></A><h1>Placing a nested report in another report </h1>
<A NAME="TI3401"></A><p>When you place a nested report in another report, the two
reports can be independent of each other or they can be related
in the database sense by sharing some common data such as a customer
number or a department number. If the reports are related, you need
to do some extra things to both the base report and the related
nested report.</p>
<A NAME="TI3402"></A><p>Usually when you place a report within a report rather than
create a composite report, you want to relate the reports. Those
instructions are first.</p>
<A NAME="BFCCACGF"></A><h2>Placing a related nested report in another report</h2>
<A NAME="TI3403"></A><p>Typically, a related nested report provides the details for
a master report. For example, a master report might provide information
about customers. A related nested report placed in the master report
could provide information about all the orders that belong to each
customer.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To place a related nested report in another report:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Create the nested report that you plan
to place in the base report.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Define a retrieval argument for the nested report.<br><br>
For example, suppose the nested report lists orders and you
want to list orders for a particular customer. To define a retrieval
argument you would:<A NAME="TI3404"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Select Design&gt;Data
Source to go to the Select painter.</li>
<li class=ds>Select Design&gt;Retrieval Arguments from
the menu bar in the Select painter.</li>
<li class=ds>Define a retrieval argument in the Specify Retrieval
Arguments dialog box. In the example, <i>customerID</i>
 is
the name assigned to the retrieval argument.
</li>
</ul>
<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Specify the retrieval argument in a WHERE clause
for the SELECT statement.<br><br>
The WHERE clause in this example tells the DBMS to retrieve
rows where the value in the column <i>cust_id</i>
 equals
the value of the argument <i>:customerid</i>
:<br><br><br><img src="images/Nest14.gif"><br>

At this point, when you run the report to retrieve data, you
are prompted to enter a value for <i>:customerid</i>
.
Later in these steps you will specify that the base report supply
the values for <i>:customerid</i>
 instead of prompting
for values.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Open or create the report you want to be the base
report.<br><br>
In the example, the base report is one that lists customers
and has a place for the order history of each customer:<br><br><br><img src="images/Nest15.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Select Insert&gt;Control&gt;Report
from the menu bar.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Click in the Design view where you want to place
the report.<br><br>
The Select Report dialog box displays listing defined reports in
the current library.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Select the report you want and click OK.<br><br>
A box representing the report displays in the Design view.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
With the report still selected, select the General
page of the Properties view. <br><br>
The Arguments box lists arguments defined for the nested report
and provides a way for you to specify how information from the base
report will be used to supply the values of arguments to the nested
report.<br><br><br><img src="images/Nest15a.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Supply the base report column or the expression
that will supply the argument's value. To do this, click
the button in the Expression column.<br><br>
The Modify Expression dialog box displays. In this dialog
box you can easily select one of the columns or develop an expression.
In the example, the column named <i>id</i>
 from the
base report will supply the value for the argument <i>:customerid</i>
 in
the nested report:<br><br><br><img src="images/Nest19.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Select File&gt;Save from the menu bar and
assign a name to the report.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
In the Preview view, you can see what your report
looks like:<br><br><br><img src="images/Nest20.gif"><br>

<A NAME="TI3405"></A><p>When you place an unrelated nested report in a base report,
the entire nested report will appear with <i>each</i>
 row
of the base report.</p>
