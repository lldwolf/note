<A NAME="BABCDEAE"></A><h1>Installing the executable application and supporting files</h1>
<A NAME="TI5561"></A><p>When you install your application on a user's machine,
make sure you include any supporting files, such as dynamic libraries,
resources such as BMP and ICO files, online Help files, and initialization
files.</p>
<A NAME="TI5562"></A><h2>Modifying the application's initialization
file</h2>
<A NAME="TI5563"></A><p>In your application's initialization file, remove
your name from the line that reads:	<pre>UserID=<i>YourID</i></pre>
</p>
<A NAME="TI5564"></A><p>An InfoMaker application's initialization file specifies
the data source that is used by the reports and forms that were
included in the application. When InfoMaker generated the initialization
file, it included your User ID. When users run your application,
they will be prompted to supply their user ID and password if:<A NAME="TI5565"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Your data source is not an ODBC data source</li>
<li class=ds>Your data source is an ODBC data source and the
user ID and password are not in the application's initialization
file
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="CFHCJDAG"></A><h2>Deploying ActiveX controls</h2>
<A NAME="TI5566"></A><p>If your application uses ActiveX controls, OLE controls, or
OCX controls you must:<A NAME="TI5567"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Deploy the control files with your application</li>
<li class=ds>Make sure each control is registered</li>
<li class=ds>Make sure required files are in the target computer's
system directory
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI5568"></A><p>If your application uses a control that is not self-registering,
your setup program needs to register it manually on each user's
computer. To find out whether a control is self-registering, see
the documentation provided with the control. Depending on the development
and deployment platforms and the controls you are deploying, you
may need to copy additional DLLs or license files to the WINDOWS
or WINNT system directories on the target computer.</p>
