<br><A NAME="TI718"></A><h4>Views in the Library painter</h4>
<A NAME="TI719"></A><p>The Library painter has two views that you use for displaying
library files (PBLs) and the objects they contain. The two views,
which are available from the View menu, are:<A NAME="TI720"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Tree</li>
<li class=ds>List
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI721"></A><p>By default, the Library painter displays one Tree view (on
the left) and one List view (on the right). When the Library painter
opens, both the Tree view and the List view display the drives that
are on your computer or mapped to it:</p>

<A NAME="TI722"></A><h4>About the Tree view and the List view</h4>
<p><b>Tree view</b>   The Tree view displays the drives and folders on the computer
and the libraries and objects they contain. Because the Tree view
displays libraries and the objects they contain, you could work
in the Tree view and not use the List view, but the List view provides
more features and is very useful.</p>
<p><b>List view</b>   The List view also displays the drives and folders on the
computer and the libraries and objects they contain, but the view
has columns with headers. For libraries, the comment column displays
any comment associated with the library. For objects, the columns
display the object name, modification date, size, and any comment
associated with the object. You can resize columns by moving the
splitter bar between columns. You can sort a column's contents by
clicking the column header.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>About sorting the Name column</span> <A NAME="TI723"></A>When you click the Name column header repeatedly to sort,
the sort happens in four ways: by object type and then name in both
ascending and descending order and by object name in both ascending
and descending order. You may not easily observe the four ways of
sorting if all objects of the same type have names that begin with
the same character or set of characters.</p>
<A NAME="TI724"></A><h4>Displaying items in the Tree view and the List view</h4>
<A NAME="TI725"></A><p>Most of the time, you select a library in the Tree view and
display the objects in that library in the List view. But at any
time, you can set a new root or move back and forward in the history
of your actions in the List view and the Tree view so libraries
or other items display. For information about setting the root, see <A HREF="imugp27.htm#CHDBIFDG">"Setting the root"</A>. For information
about moving back or forward, see <A HREF="imugp27.htm#CHDBAFAE">"Moving back, forward, and
up one level"</A>.</p>
