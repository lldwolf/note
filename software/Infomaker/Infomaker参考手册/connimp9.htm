<A NAME="CCJCCDFI"></A><h1>About preparing ODBC data sources</h1>
<A NAME="TI216"></A><p>The first step in connecting to an ODBC data source is to
prepare to use the data source. Preparing the data source ensures
that you are able to connect to it and use your data in InfoMaker.</p>
<A NAME="TI217"></A><p>You prepare to use a data source <i>outside</i>
 InfoMaker <i>before</i>
 you
start the product, define the data source, and connect to it. The
requirements differ for each data source--but in general,
preparing to use a data source involves the following steps.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To prepare to use an ODBC data source with InfoMaker:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
If network software is required to access
the data source, make sure it is properly installed and configured
at your site and on the client workstation.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
If database software is required, make sure it
is properly installed and configured on your computer or network
server.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Make sure the required data files are present
on your computer or network server.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Make sure the names of tables and columns you
want to access follow standard SQL naming conventions.<br><br>
The data source is case senstitive. Avoid using all lowercase
characters, blank spaces, or database-specific reserved words in
table and column names. It is safest to use all uppercase characters
when naming tables and columns that you want to access in InfoMaker. <br><br><p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Backquote character not allowed as a delimiter</span> <A NAME="TI218"></A>The online Help supplied for the MERANT ODBC drivers indicates
that you can use the backquote (`) character, also known as the
grave character, as a delimiter for table and column names that
do not follow standard SQL naming conventions.</p>
<A NAME="TI219"></A>However, InfoMaker does <i>not</i>
 currently
allow use of the backquote character as a delimiter for table and
column names.</p>
<A NAME="TI220"></A>To ensure that you can access your tables and columns in InfoMaker, avoid
using nonstandard characters (such as all lowercase, mixed case, blank
spaces, or database-specific reserved words) when naming tables and
columns. </p>
</li>
<li class=ds>
If your database requires it, make sure the tables
you want to access have unique indexes.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Install both of the following using the InfoMaker Setup
program:<A NAME="TI221"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>The ODBC driver
that accesses your data source</li>
<li class=ds>The ODBC interface 
</li>
</ul>
