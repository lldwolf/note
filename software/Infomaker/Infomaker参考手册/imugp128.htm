<A NAME="X-ref289232258"></A><h1>About applications</h1>
<A NAME="TI5320"></A><p>When you have completed reports, forms, or data pipelines,
you can bundle them in an executable file to create a reporting
and database-maintenance application. The reports, forms, and pipelines
in an application are usually related by topic, but they need not
be. You can bundle any reports, forms, and pipelines you want.</p>
<A NAME="TI5321"></A><h4>Where you create an application</h4>
<A NAME="TI5322"></A><p>In InfoMaker, you create applications using a wizard accessed
in the Library painter. The wizard prompts you for the reports,
forms, and pipelines you want to include and for other aspects of
the application such as the icon to be used to represent the application.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>No queries</span> <A NAME="TI5323"></A>InfoMaker applications do not include queries, which also
display in the Library painter.</p>
<A NAME="TI5324"></A><h4>Identifying an application</h4>
<A NAME="TI5325"></A><p>Most applications can be identified by selecting Help&gt;About
to display information about the application such as its name, name
of the company producing the application, version, and so on. After
you create an application, you can modify the application's
initialization file so that your users see customized information.</p>
<A NAME="TI5326"></A><p>For information about identifying your application,
see <A HREF="imugp131.htm#BFCBEBHJ">"Identifying your application"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI5327"></A><h4>Running an application</h4>
<A NAME="TI5328"></A><p>You can run the application the same way you run other Windows
applications. After you start the application, you can run the reports
and forms and pipelines included in the application.</p>
<A NAME="TI5329"></A><h4>Using pipelines in an application</h4>
<A NAME="TI5330"></A><p>Having the ability to execute pipelines in an application
is particularly useful for mobile users working on laptops that
are often not connected to a corporate database. You can pipe a
corporate database to the laptop, use forms to update the database,
and run reports against the local database. Then you can pipe the local
data to the corporate database.</p>
<A NAME="TI5331"></A><p>For information about executing a pipeline
in an application and modifying the pipeline definition from the
application, see <A HREF="imugp132.htm#BFCBFAGF">"Using a pipeline in an application"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI5332"></A><h4>Distributing an application</h4>
<A NAME="TI5333"></A><p>An application can be for your personal use only, but you
can also distribute it to others to use. Users can run your application
outside the InfoMaker environment. Having InfoMaker installed
is not required.</p>
<A NAME="TI5334"></A><p>The requirements for distributing an application with a pipeline
differ from the requirements for distributing an application with
only forms and reports because pipelines can modify the database
by adding and dropping tables.</p>
<A NAME="TI5335"></A><p>For information about distributing InfoMaker applications
to others, see <A HREF="imugp134.htm#CFHBBAEA">Chapter 18, "Deploying Your Application"</A>.</p>
