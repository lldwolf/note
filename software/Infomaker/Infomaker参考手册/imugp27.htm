<A NAME="TI726"></A><p>You work with libraries in the Library painter.</p>
<A NAME="CHDBCFCC"></A><h2>Displaying libraries and objects</h2>
<A NAME="TI727"></A><h4>What you see in the views</h4>
<A NAME="TI728"></A><p>In the Tree view, you can expand items and see the folders,
libraries, or objects they contain. You cannot see any files that
are not library files. In the List view, you do not see expansions
and contractions of contents. The List view displays only contents. For
example, here the TUTOR_IM.PBL has been selected in the Tree
view (and then expanded). When the PBL was selected, its contents displayed
in the List view.</p>
<br><img src="images/Libim29.gif">
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>If the Form painter and Data Pipeline painter are not
installed</span> <A NAME="TI729"></A>Even if the Form painter and the Data Pipeline painter are
not installed, if a library contains forms and pipelines, you see
them in the Library painter.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To expand or collapse an item in the Tree view:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Double-click the item.<br><br>
If the item contains libraries or objects, they display in
the List view.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To display the contents of an item in the List
view:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select the item in the Tree view.<br><br>
<i>or</i>
<br><br>
Double-click the item in the List view.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI730"></A><h4>Using drag and drop to expand items</h4>
<A NAME="TI731"></A><p>You can drag and drop items to expand them and see the contents:</p>
<A NAME="TI732"></A><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=1 frame="void" rules="all"><tr><th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI733"></A>If you drag an item from a</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI734"></A>And drop it in a</th>
<th align="left" valign=bottom><A NAME="TI735"></A>This happens</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI736"></A>Tree view or List view</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI737"></A>List view</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI738"></A>The List view sets the item as the root
and displays the contents</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top><A NAME="TI739"></A>Tree view or List view</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI740"></A>Tree view</td>
<td valign=top><A NAME="TI741"></A>The Tree view expands to that item</td>
</tr>
</table>
<A NAME="TI742"></A><p>For example, you can drag a library from the Tree view and
drop it in the List view to quickly display the objects the library
contains in the List view. </p>
<A NAME="TI743"></A><p>For information about using drag and drop to copy or move
items, see <A HREF="imugp27.htm#X-ref302058104">"Copying, moving, and
deleting objects"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI744"></A><h2>Using
the popup menu</h2>
<A NAME="TI745"></A><p>Like the other painters, the Library painter has a popup menu
that provides menu items that apply to the selected item in the
Tree view or the List view. For example, from a library's
popup menu, you can delete, search, optimize, print the directory,
set the library as the working (current) library, specify the objects that
display in that library, or display library properties. From an
object's popup menu, you can edit (go to the painter),
copy, move, or delete the object.</p>
<A NAME="TI746"></A><h2>Controlling columns that display in the List view</h2>
<A NAME="TI747"></A><p>You can control whether to display the last modification date,
compilation date, size, and comments (if a comment was created when
an object or library was created) in the List view.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To control the display of columns in the List
view:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select Design&gt;Options from the
menu bar.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
On the General tab page, select or clear these
display items: Modification Date, Compilation Date, Sizes, and Comments.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI748"></A><h2>Selecting
objects</h2>
<A NAME="TI749"></A><p>In the List view, you can select one or more libraries or
objects to act on.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To select multiple entries:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
In the List view, use ctrl+click (for
individual entries) and shift+click (for
a group of entries).<br><br></li></ol>
<br><p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To select all entries:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
In the List view, select an object and
then click the Select All button on the PainterBar.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="CHDDBGGE"></A><h2>Filtering the display of objects</h2>
<A NAME="TI750"></A><p>You can change which objects display in expanded libraries. </p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Settings are remembered</span> <A NAME="TI751"></A>InfoMaker records your preferences in the Library section
of the InfoMaker initialization file so that the next time you
open the Library painter, the same objects and information are displayed.</p>
<A NAME="TI752"></A><h4>Specifying which objects display in all libraries</h4>
<A NAME="TI753"></A><p>Initially in the Tree and List views, the Library painter
displays all objects in libraries that you expand. You can specify
that the Library painter display in all libraries only specific
kinds of objects and/or objects whose names match a specific
pattern. For example, you can limit the display to only DataWindow objects,
or limit the display to windows that begin with w_emp.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To restrict which objects are displayed:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select Design&gt;Options from the
menu bar and select the Include tab. <br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
In the Options property sheet, specify the display
criteria:<br><br>
<A NAME="TI754"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>To limit the display
to entries that contain specific text in their names, enter the
text in the Name box. You can use the wildcard characters question
mark (?) and asterisk (*) in the string: ? represents one character, * represents
any string of characters. The default is all entries of the selected
types.</li>
<li class=ds>To limit the display to specific entry types, clear
the checkboxes for the entry types that you do not want to display.
The default is all entries.
</li>
</ul>
<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Click OK.<br><br>
The Options property sheet closes.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
In the Tree view, expand libraries or select a
library to display the objects that meet the criteria.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI755"></A><h4>Overriding the choices you made for a specific
view</h4>
<A NAME="TI756"></A><p>In either the Tree view or the List view, you can override
your choice of objects that display in all libraries by selecting
a library, displaying the library's popup menu, and then
clearing or selecting items on the list of objects.</p>
<A NAME="TI757"></A><h2>Filtering the display of libraries and folders</h2>
<A NAME="TI758"></A><p>In either the Tree view or the List view, you can control
what displays when you expand a drive or folder, An expanded drive
or folder can display only libraries, only folders, or both.</p>

<ol><li class=fi>
In either view, select a drive or folder
and then select or clear Libraries and/or Folders from
the popup menu.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI759"></A><h2>Working in the current library</h2>
<A NAME="TI760"></A><p>In InfoMaker, you are always working in a current library.
The most recent object is the object you most recently opened.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To display objects in the current library:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Click in the Tree view or the List view.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>

<br><A NAME="X-ref302058104"></A><h2>Copying, moving, and deleting objects</h2>
<A NAME="TI766"></A><p>As your needs change, you may want to rearrange the objects
in libraries. To do that, you need to be able to copy and move objects
between libraries or delete objects that you no longer need.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To copy or move objects using drag and drop:</p>

<li class=ds>
Drag the objects to a library in either view (or
if the contents of a library are displayed in the List view, you
can drop the objects there).<br><br>
If copying, InfoMaker replicates the objects. If moving, InfoMaker moves the
objects and deletes them from the source library. If an object with
the same name already exists, InfoMaker prompts you and, if you
allow it, replaces the existing object with the copied or moved
object.<br><br></li></ol>
