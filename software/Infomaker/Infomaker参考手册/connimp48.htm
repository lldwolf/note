<A NAME="TI1496"></A><h4>What is the PBODB80 initialization file? </h4>
<A NAME="TI1497"></A><p>When you access data through the ODBC interface, InfoMaker uses
the PBODB80 initialization file to maintain access to extended functionality
in the backend DBMS for which ODBC does not provide an API call.
Examples of extended functionality are SQL syntax or function calls
specific to a particular DBMS.</p>
<A NAME="TI1498"></A><h4>Editing the PBODB80 initialization file</h4>
<A NAME="TI1499"></A><p>In most cases, you should <i>not</i>
 need to
modify the PBODB80 initialization file. Changes to this file can
adversely affect InfoMaker. You should change the PBODB80 initialization
file only if you are asked to do so by a Technical Support representative.</p>
<A NAME="TI1500"></A><p>However, you <i>can</i>
 edit the PBODB80 initialization
file if you need to add functions for your backend DBMS.</p>
<A NAME="TI1501"></A><p>If you modify the PBODB80 initialization file, first make
a copy of the existing file. Then keep a record of all changes you
make. If you call Technical Support after modifying the PBODB80
initialization file, tell the representative that you changed the
file and describe the changes you made.</p>
<A NAME="TI1502"></A><h4>Name of the PBODB80 initialization file</h4>
<A NAME="TI1503"></A><p>The name of the PBODB80 initialization file is PBODB80.INI.</p>
<A NAME="TI1504"></A><p>For simplicity, this appendix refers generically to the PBODB80
initialization file throughout.</p>
