<A NAME="BCDBICBC"></A><h1>About data pipelines </h1>
<A NAME="TI4471"></A><p>The Data Pipeline painter gives you the ability to quickly
reproduce data within a database, across databases, or even across
DBMSs. To do that, you create a data pipeline which, when executed, <strong>pipes</strong> the
data as specified in the definition of the data pipeline.</p>
<A NAME="TI4472"></A><h4>What you can do</h4>
<A NAME="TI4473"></A><p>With the Data Pipeline painter, you can perform some tasks
that would otherwise be very time consuming. For example, you can:<A NAME="TI4474"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Pipe data (and extended attributes)
from one or more tables to a table in the same DBMS or a different
DBMS</li>
<li class=ds>Pipe an entire database, a table at a time, to another
DBMS (and if needed, pipe the database's extended attribute
system tables)</li>
<li class=ds>Create a table with the same design as an existing
table but with no data</li>
<li class=ds>Pipe corporate data from a database server to an Adaptive Server Anywhere database
on your computer so you can work on the data and report on it without
needing access to the network</li>
<li class=ds>Upload local data that changes daily to a corporate
database</li>
<li class=ds>Create a new table when a change (such as allowing
or disallowing NULLs or changing primary key or index assignments)
is disallowed in the Table painter
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI4475"></A><h4>Source and destination databases</h4>
<A NAME="TI4476"></A><p>You can use the Data Pipeline painter to pipe data from <i>one
or more</i>
 tables in a <strong>source database</strong> to <i>one</i>
 table
in a <strong>destination database</strong>:</p>
<br><img src="images/pipes010.gif">
<A NAME="TI4477"></A><p>You can pipe all data or selected data in one or more tables.
For example, you can pipe a few columns of data from one table or
data selected from a multitable join. You can also pipe from a view
or a stored procedure result set to a table.</p>
<A NAME="TI4478"></A><p>When you pipe data, the data in the source database remains
in the source database and is reproduced in a new or existing table
in the destination database.</p>
<A NAME="TI4479"></A><p>Although the source and destination can be the same database,
they are usually different ones, and they can even have different
DBMSs. For example, you can pipe data from a SQL Server database
to an Adaptive Server Anywhere database on your computer.</p>
<A NAME="TI4480"></A><h2>Defining a data pipeline</h2>
<A NAME="TI4481"></A><p>When you use the Data Pipeline painter to create a pipeline,
you define:<A NAME="TI4482"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Source database</li>
<li class=ds>Destination database</li>
<li class=ds>Source of data</li>
<li class=ds>Pipeline operation</li>
<li class=ds>Destination table
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI4483"></A><h4>Once you define it</h4>
<A NAME="TI4484"></A><p>After you create a pipeline, you can execute it immediately.
If you want, you can also save it as a named object to use and reuse:</p>
<br><img src="images/pipes020.gif">
<A NAME="TI4485"></A><p>Saving a pipeline enables you to pipe the data that may have
changed since the last pipeline execution or to pipe the data to
other databases later.</p>
<A NAME="TI4486"></A><h4>Data type support</h4>
<A NAME="TI4487"></A><p>Each DBMS has certain data types it supports. When you pipe
data from one DBMS to a different DBMS, InfoMaker makes its best
guess for the destination data types. You can correct InfoMaker's
best guess in your pipeline definition as needed.</p>
<A NAME="TI4488"></A><p>The Data Pipeline painter supports the piping of columns of
any data type, including columns with blob data.</p>
<A NAME="TI4489"></A><p>For information about piping a column that
has a blob data type, see <A HREF="imugp109.htm#BCDBIHGG">"Piping blob data"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI4490"></A><h2>Piping extended attributes</h2>
<A NAME="TI4491"></A><p>The first time InfoMaker connects to a database, it creates
five system tables, called the <strong>extended attribute system
tables</strong>. These system tables initially contain default
extended attribute information for tables and columns. In InfoMaker,
you can create extended attribute definitions, such as column headers
and labels, edit styles, display formats, and validation rules.</p>
<A NAME="TI4492"></A><p>For more information about the extended attribute
system tables, see <A HREF="imugp256.htm#CCJEBFGB">Appendix A, "The Extended
Attribute System Tables"</A>.</p>
<A NAME="TI4493"></A><h4>Piping extended attributes automatically</h4>
<A NAME="TI4494"></A><p>When you pipe data, you can specify that you want to pipe
the extended attributes associated with the columns you are piping.
You do this by selecting the Extended Attributes checkbox in the
Data Pipeline painter workspace:</p>
<br><img src="images/pipes030.gif">
<A NAME="TI4495"></A><p>When the Extended Attributes checkbox is selected, the extended
attributes associated with the source database's selected
columns automatically go into the extended attribute system tables
of the destination database, with the following exception.</p>
<A NAME="TI4496"></A><h4>When extended attributes are not automatically
piped</h4>
<A NAME="TI4497"></A><p>When you pipe a column that has an edit style, display format,
or validation rule associated with it, the style, rule, or format
will <i>not</i>
 be piped if one with the same name
exists in the extended attribute system tables of the destination database.
In this situation, the column uses the style, rule, or format already present
in the destination database.</p>
<A NAME="TI4498"></A><p>For example, for the Phone column in the Employee table, the
display format with the name Phone_format would be piped
unless a display format with the name Phone_format already
exists in the destination database. If such a display format exists,
the Phone column would use the Phone_format display format in
the destination database.</p>
<A NAME="TI4499"></A><h4>Piping the extended attribute system tables</h4>
<A NAME="TI4500"></A><p>Selecting the Extended Attributes checkbox <i>never</i>
 results
in the piping of named display formats, edit styles, and validation
rules that are stored in the extended attribute system tables but
are not associated with columns in tables you are piping. If you
want such extended attribute definitions from one database to exist
in another database, you can pipe the appropriate extended attribute
system table or a selected row or rows from the table.</p>
<A NAME="TI4501"></A><h4>Piping an entire database</h4>
<A NAME="TI4502"></A><p>If you want to reproduce an entire database, you can pipe
all database tables and extended attribute system tables, one table
at a time.</p>
