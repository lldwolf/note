<A NAME="CAIDGFJC"></A><h1>Storing data in a report using the Data view</h1>
<A NAME="TI2134"></A><p>Usually you retrieve data into a report from the database--the
data is changeable and you want the latest. But sometimes the data you
display in a report is static--it never changes. Or
you may want a snapshot of the data at a certain point in time.
In these situations, you may want to store the data in the report itself.
That way you don't need to go out to the database or other
data source to display the data.</p>
<A NAME="TI2135"></A><p>The most common reason to store data in a report is for
use as a dropdown DataWindow where the data is not coming from a
database. For example, you might want to display a list of state
postal codes for entering values in a State column in a form.
You can store those codes in a report and use the DropDownDataWindow
edit style for the State column.</p>
<A NAME="TI2136"></A><p>For more information about using the DropDownDataWindow
edit style, see <A HREF="imugp62.htm#CAIDCCJB">Chapter 6, "Displaying and Validating
Data "</A>.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To store data in a report:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select View&gt;Data from the menu bar.<br><br>
The Data view displays. All columns defined for the report are
listed at the top.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Do any of the following:<A NAME="TI2137"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Click the Insert Row button in the PainterBar to create an
empty row and type a row of data. You can enter as many rows as
you want.</li>
<li class=ds>Click the Retrieve button in the PainterBar to retrieve
all the rows of data from the database. If you want, you can delete
rows you don't want to save or manually add new rows.</li>
<li class=ds>Click the Delete button in the PainterBar to delete
unwanted rows.
</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br><img src="images/dwen33.gif"><br>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Data changes are local to the report</span> <A NAME="TI2138"></A>Adding or deleting data here does not change the data in the
database. It only determines what data will be stored with the report when
you save it. The Update DB button is disabled.</p>
</li>
<li class=ds>
When you have finished, save the report.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI2139"></A><p>When you save the report, the data is stored in the report. </p>
<A NAME="TI2140"></A><h4>Sharing data with the Preview view</h4>
<A NAME="TI2141"></A><p>To see changes you make in the Data view reflected in the
Preview view, select ShareData from the popup menu in the Data view. The Preview view shows data
from the storage buffer associated with the Data view.</p>
<A NAME="TI2142"></A><h2>What happens when you run the report</h2>
<A NAME="TI2143"></A><p>When you run a report with stored data, the data is already
there. InfoMaker does not retrieve data.</p>
<A NAME="TI2144"></A><p>With one exception, if you <i>do</i>
 issue Retrieve
for a report stored with data, InfoMaker handles it the same
as a report that is not stored with data: InfoMaker gets the
latest data by retrieving rows from the database.</p>
<A NAME="TI2145"></A><h4>The exception</h4>
<A NAME="TI2146"></A><p>InfoMaker never retrieves data into a dropdown DataWindow
that already contains data.</p>
