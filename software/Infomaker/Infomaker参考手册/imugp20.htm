<A NAME="TI605"></A><p>Your InfoMaker configuration information is stored in both
the IM.INI file and the registry. When you start InfoMaker, it
looks in the registry and the InfoMaker initialization file to
set up your environment.</p>
<A NAME="TI606"></A><h2>About the registry</h2>
<A NAME="TI607"></A><p>Some InfoMaker features require the use of the IM.INI file,
but many features now use the registry to get and store configuration
information. Normally, you should not need to access or modify items
in the registry.</p>
<A NAME="TI608"></A><p>Information related to your preferences (such as the way you
have arranged your views in the painters and the shortcut keys you
have defined for InfoMaker menu items) is stored in<br> Hkey_Current_User/Software/Sybase/InfoMaker/8.0<i></i>
. </p>
<A NAME="TI609"></A><p>Installation-related information is stored in Hkey_Local_Machine/Software/Sybase/InfoMaker/8.0<i></i>
.</p>
<A NAME="TI610"></A><h2>About the initialization file</h2>
<A NAME="TI611"></A><p>The initialization file is a text file that contains variables
that specify your InfoMaker preferences. These preferences include
information such as the last database you connected to and the PBL
you are using. When you perform certain actions in InfoMaker, InfoMaker writes
your preferences to the initialization file automatically. </p>
<A NAME="TI612"></A><h4>Specifying preferences</h4>
<A NAME="TI613"></A><p>Normally, you do not need to edit the initialization file.
You can specify all your preferences by taking an action, such as
resizing a window or opening a new application, or by selecting
Design&gt;Options from one of the painters. But sometimes
a variable does not appear by default in the options sheet for the painter.
In this case, you can use a text editor to modify the variable in
the appropriate section of the initialization file.</p>
<p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>Editing the initialization file</span> <A NAME="TI614"></A>Do not use a text editor to edit the InfoMaker initialization
file or any preferences file while InfoMaker is running. InfoMaker caches
the contents of initialization files in memory and overwrites your
edited InfoMaker initialization file when it exits, ignoring changes.</p>
<A NAME="TI615"></A><h4>Format of INI files</h4>
<A NAME="TI616"></A><p>The InfoMaker initialization file uses the Windows INI file
format. It has three types of elements:<A NAME="TI617"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>Section names, which are enclosed in square brackets</li>
<li class=ds>Keywords, which are the names of preference settings</li>
<li class=ds>Values, which are numeric or text strings, assigned
as the value of the associated keyword
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<A NAME="TI618"></A><p>A variable can be listed with no value specified, in which
case the default is used.</p>
<A NAME="TI619"></A><p>Some sections are always present by default, but others are
created only when you specify different preferences. If you specify
preferences for another painter or tool, InfoMaker creates a new
section for it at the end of the file.</p>
<A NAME="TI620"></A><h4>Where the initialization file is kept</h4>
<A NAME="TI621"></A><p>The initialization file is called IM.INI and is installed
in the same directory as the InfoMaker executable file.</p>
<A NAME="TI622"></A><h4>Telling InfoMaker where your initialization
file is</h4>
<A NAME="TI623"></A><p>You can keep your initialization file in another location
and tell InfoMaker where it can find it by specifying the location
in the System Options dialog box. You may want to do this if you
use more than one version of InfoMaker or if you are running InfoMaker over
a network.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To record your initialization path:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Select Tools&gt;System Options from
the menu bar.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
On the General tab page, enter the path of your
initialization file in the Initialization Path textbox.<br><br>
InfoMaker records the path in the Windows registry.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI624"></A><h4>How InfoMaker finds the initialization file</h4>
<A NAME="TI625"></A><p>InfoMaker looks in the Windows Registry for a path to the
file, and then looks for the file in the directory where InfoMaker is
installed. If InfoMaker cannot find the initialization file using
the path in the Registry, it clears the path value.</p>
<A NAME="TI626"></A><h4>If the initialization file is missing</h4>
<A NAME="TI627"></A><p>If InfoMaker does not find the initialization file when it
starts up, it recreates it. However, if you want to retain any preferences
you have set, such as database profiles, keep a backup copy of your
initialization file. The recreated file has the default preferences.</p>
