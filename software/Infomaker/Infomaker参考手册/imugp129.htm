<A NAME="X-ref307909502"></A><h1>Creating an application</h1>
<A NAME="TI5336"></A><p>When you create an application, all the reports, forms, and
pipelines you include must be in one library (PBL). In the Library
painter, you can move or copy reports, forms, and pipelines from
one library to another as needed.</p>
<A NAME="TI5337"></A><p>For information about moving or copying objects,
see <A HREF="imugp22.htm#CAICGJAJ">Chapter 2, "Working with Libraries"</A>.</p>
<p><img src="images/proc.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Steps"> To create an application:</p>
<ol><li class=fi>
Connect to the database that the executable
will use.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Open the Library painter and the library containing
the objects you want to include in the application.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Select Design&gt;Create Executable from
the menu bar.<br><br>
If you are creating your first application in the current
library, the Create Executable dialog box displays.<br><br><br><img src="images/wwapp010.gif"><br>

If you have created applications in the current library before,
a message box displays asking whether you want to reuse the objects
in the most recently created application and avoid starting from
scratch.<br><br>
For information, see <A HREF="imugp130.htm#X-ref308517796">"Reusing an application"</A>.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Enter a title that will be used in the title bar
of the running application.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Name your application's executable file
by filling in the Executable File Name box.<br><br>
The filename you supply is the name of the executable file
that will be created. You can use a short or long filename with
or without spaces. Be sure to retain the EXE file extension.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
To specify the location of the executable file,
click the Browse button and navigate to the correct folder.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Click the Browse button next to the Executable
Icon box to assign an icon to the executable file.<br><br>
The Select Icon dialog box displays.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Navigate to an ICO file and click Open.<br><br>
The icon you choose will be used if you create a shortcut
for the executable file and when you minimize the executable.<br><br>
You return to the Create Executable dialog box. The following
example shows the dialog box filled in.<br><br><br><img src="images/Wwapp020.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Click Next.<br><br>
The Select Items dialog box displays listing all the reports,
forms, and pipelines in the library you are using for your application.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
Select the reports, forms, and pipelines you want
to package in the application.<br><br><br><img src="images/wwapp030.gif"><br>
</li>
<li class=ds>
Click Next.<br><br>
The Executable Items dialog box displays, listing all reports,
forms, and pipelines you have selected for the executable file:<br><br><br><img src="images/wwapp040.gif"><br>

In the Executable Items dialog box, you can define the properties
of a toolbar button for any of the items in the executable. Then
in the application you can run the report, form, or pipeline by
simply clicking the toolbar button.<br><br>
By default, InfoMaker creates an Objects menu in the application
that lists all reports, forms, and pipelines. If you do not specify
button text for an object, the object name displays in the Objects
menu.<br><br>
InfoMaker also creates a File menu in the application. You
can select File&gt;Open Form, File&gt;Open Report, or
File&gt;Open Pipeline and then select a form, report, or pipeline
from the list that displays. <br><br><p><img src="images/note.gif" width=17 height=17 border=0 align="bottom" alt="Note"> <span class=shaded>To quickly prototype an application</span> <A NAME="TI5338"></A>The remaining steps describe how to define text, MicroHelp,
and pictures for the application's toolbar buttons. You
can create an application quickly by clicking Finish now. After
you test your prototype, you can reuse the application definition
and finish the remaining steps (which define the toolbar buttons).</p>
</li>
<li class=ds>
If you want a toolbar button for a report, form,
or pipeline, specify a picture for the button, the text you want
to show on the button, and MicroHelp text that displays when the
button is clicked:<br><br>
<A NAME="TI5339"></A>
<ol>
</li>
<li class=ds>Select the report,
form, or pipeline in the Executable Items dialog box.</li>
<li class=ds>In the Picture dropdown listbox, select the picture
you want to display in the button for the report, form, or pipeline.
The image you choose displays next to the listbox.</li>
<li class=ds>In the Text box, type the text you want to display
in the button for the report, form, or pipeline. Up to 14 characters
will display on a button.</li>
<li class=ds>In the MicroHelp box, type the MicroHelp text you
want to display when the user of the executable selects the button:<br><img src="images/wwapp050.gif">

</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
Most of the time you should provide text for a button. If
no button text is provided, the object name displays as the button
text and in the list of objects in the Objects menu.<br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
If you want to omit a report from the list of
reports in the generated application so that users cannot run it
as a standalone report, select the report and then select the Hide
Report checkbox. This is useful for reports that have been included
only to support a:<A NAME="TI5340"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>DropDownDataWindow edit
style</li>
<li class=ds>Report added to a form</li>
<li class=ds>Report nested in another report
</li>
</ul>

                    <br><br></li>
<li class=ds>
When you have defined all the toolbar items, click
Finish.<br><br></li></ol>
<br><A NAME="TI5341"></A><h4>What happens</h4>
<A NAME="TI5342"></A><p>InfoMaker creates two files:</p>
<A NAME="TI5343"></A><p><A NAME="TI5344"></A>
<ul>
<li class=fi>The executable file
with the name you supplied.</li>
<li class=ds>An initialization file with the same name. For example,
if you created the executable file SALES.EXE, InfoMaker also creates
a file named SALES.INI. The initialization file records which database
is used by the executable file.
</li>
</ul>

<A NAME="TI5346"></A><h4>Identifying your application</h4>
<A NAME="TI5347"></A><p>By default, InfoMaker includes brand information to identify
your application when a user displays the Help&gt;About window.
You can make modify the application's initialization file
to customize the information that identifies your application.</p>

<A NAME="TI5349"></A><h4>An application includes a query governor</h4>
<A NAME="TI5350"></A><p>InfoMaker includes a query governor in an InfoMaker application automatically.
The query governor lets you specify the maximum number of rows to
be retrieved and the maximum time for retrieval.</p>
